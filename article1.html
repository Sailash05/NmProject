  <u><em><h2>Data structure and algorithm</h2></em></u>
  <p>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming, crucial for developing efficient and optimized software.</p>
  <p>Data structures are methods for organizing and storing data in a computer's memory to facilitate efficient access and modification. They define the relationships between data elements and the operations that can be performed on them. Common data structures include:</p>

  <h3>Linear Data Structures:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Arrays: Collections of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for constant-time access by index.</li>
    <li>Linked Lists: Collections of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node, offering flexible insertion and deletion.</li>
    <li>Stacks: Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structures, where elements are added and removed from the same end.</li>
    <li>Queues: First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structures, where elements are added at one end and removed from the other.</li>
    <li>Hash Tables: Data structures that map keys to values using a hash function, providing fast average-case lookup, insertion, and deletion.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Non-linear Data Structures:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Trees: Hierarchical data structures where elements are organized in a parent-child relationship. Examples include Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and Heaps.</li>
    <li>Graphs: Collections of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them, representing relationships between entities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Algorithms:</h3>
  <p>Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or sets of instructions designed to solve specific computational problems. They take input, perform operations, and produce an output. Common algorithm types include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong> Arrange elements in a particular order, e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.</li>
    <li><strong>Searching Algorithms:</strong> Find specific elements in data structures, e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search.</li>
    <li><strong>Graph Algorithms:</strong> Traverse and analyze graphs, e.g., Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Technique for solving complex problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Importance of DSA:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Efficient Problem Solving:</strong> Choosing the right data structure and algorithm improves program performance and resource usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimized Code:</strong> Leads to faster-running and memory-efficient applications, especially with large datasets.</li>
    <li><strong>Career Opportunities:</strong> Mastery of DSA is crucial for technical interviews and software engineering roles.</li>
    <li><strong>Foundational Skills:</strong> Enhances logical thinking, coding skills, and understanding of software design.</li>

<section id="oops">
  <u><em><h2>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2></em></u>
  <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" which contain data and methods to manipulate that data. It helps create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.</p>
  <p>OOP organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. The main principles of OOP include:</p>

  <h3>Core Concepts of OOP:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Class:</strong> A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class can use.</li>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> An instance of a class that contains actual data and can perform behaviors defined by its class.</li>
    <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, restricting direct access to some of an objectâ€™s components.</li>
    <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> A mechanism where one class (child/subclass) can inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent/superclass), promoting code reuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, typically by method overriding or overloading.</li>
    <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> The concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Types of Inheritance:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Single Inheritance: A subclass inherits from one superclass.</li>
    <li>Multiple Inheritance: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses (supported in some languages).</li>
    <li>Multilevel Inheritance: A subclass inherits from a superclass which itself is a subclass of another class.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>OOP Benefits:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Code is organized into discrete objects that can be developed and tested independently.</li>
    <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Inheritance allows for reuse of existing code, reducing redundancy.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Encapsulation helps protect object integrity by preventing unintended interference.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> OOP systems can be easily extended with new objects and behaviors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common OOP Languages:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Ruby</li>
  </ul>

<section id="networks">
  <u><em><h2>Computer Networks</h2></em></u>
  <p>Computer Networks refer to the interconnected system of computers and devices that communicate with each other to share resources and information. Networking enables data exchange over distances ranging from a few meters to thousands of kilometers.</p>
  <p>Networks are fundamental for the internet, intranets, and various communication services. Key concepts in computer networking include:</p>

  <h3>Types of Networks:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Area Network (LAN):</strong> A network that connects computers within a limited area like a home, school, or office building.</li>
    <li><strong>Wide Area Network (WAN):</strong> A network that covers a broad area, often connecting multiple LANs across cities or countries.</li>
    <li><strong>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):</strong> Larger than LAN but smaller than WAN, typically covering a city or campus.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Area Network (PAN):</strong> A network for personal devices within a small area, like Bluetooth connections between phone and headset.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Networking Models:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OSI Model:</strong> A conceptual framework with seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application) that standardizes communication functions.</li>
    <li><strong>TCP/IP Model:</strong> A practical model used in real-world networks, consisting of four layers (Link, Internet, Transport, Application).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common Protocols:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HTTP/HTTPS:</strong> Protocols for web communication.</li>
    <li><strong>FTP:</strong> File Transfer Protocol for transferring files.</li>
    <li><strong>TCP:</strong> Transmission Control Protocol ensuring reliable communication.</li>
    <li><strong>IP:</strong> Internet Protocol responsible for addressing and routing packets.</li>
    <li><strong>DNS:</strong> Domain Name System that translates domain names to IP addresses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Network Devices:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Router:</strong> Directs data packets between different networks.</li>
    <li><strong>Switch:</strong> Connects devices within a LAN and forwards data to the correct device.</li>
    <li><strong>Hub:</strong> Broadcasts data to all devices on a network segment.</li>
    <li><strong>Modem:</strong> Modulates and demodulates signals for internet access.</li>
  </ul>

    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Supports email, messaging, and video conferencing.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Centralization:</strong> Allows centralized management and storage of data.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Networks can grow with organizational needs.</li>
  </ul>
